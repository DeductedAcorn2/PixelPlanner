# PixelPlanner
A World Planner for the game Pixel Worlds written in C#.

This is a work-in-progress and expect stuff to be broken if you happen to compile it by yourself.
The sprites are included here, and are obviously used with permission from Kukouri Mobile Entertainment. They should not be used anywhere else.

## Features
- Build/Delete Tiles
- Save/Load Worlds and save entire canvas to `.png`
- Custom Backgrounds color or Orbs
- Zooming (Slider, or Shift+Mouse Scroll)
- Update Check
